# Theme Park Map Builder - Group Project

As a team you will create a interactive map of a theme park. The park will include different areas with attractions and events.

## Getting Started

> **Pro Tip:** If you find yourself writing logic on the first day, then you did not spend enough time planning, and gaining clarification on the acceptance criteria.

1. Review the [product owner's tickets](https://github.com/nss-nightclass-projects/theme-park/issues)
1. Create Firebase account for your team upload the boilerplate JSON data for use in this application.
1. Be sure to set your Firebase rules for indexing.

## Technical Considerations
* Data is required to be requested from Firebase based on collections. Pull only what you need.
* Consider encapsulating all Firebase calls into a single module.
* Use SASS to control your color themes. 
* Incorporate Bootstrap for your CSS grid framework and nav bar components.

## Technology Requirements
* SASS
* JQuery 
* Grunt (with JSHINT) 
* Promises
* Browserify
* Bootstrap Grid Framework
* Firebase for data storage and retrieval
